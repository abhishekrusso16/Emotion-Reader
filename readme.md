# Facial Emotion Detection App 😄

This is a deep learning-based web application that detects human emotions from facial images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on grayscale facial images of 18 different emotions, and the interface is built using **Streamlit**.

## 🔍 Features

- Upload an image and get the predicted emotion instantly.
- Real-time emotion classification using a trained PyTorch model.
- Covers multiple emotion classes (anger, sadness, surprise, etc.).
- Simple web interface using Streamlit.
